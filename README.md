# Applying Machine Learning to TCC Streetcar Dataset To Predict Delays
In this project, we created a machine learning program to forecast and
prevent streetcar delays using TTC Streetcar Delay Data. Three machine learning models (RNN, XGBoost and Decision Tree Algorithm) are applied and their results are discussed in the report.

## To Run
1: To create data files required for training, run data preprocessing notebook.\
2: To train the models, run TCC_Training_NN_XGB_DTC notebook.\
3: Custom_classes consists of the assisting functions.
